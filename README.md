### Key Findings
1. Sales grew by 25.06% compared to the previous year, showing positive interest by customer.
2. Australia contributed over 26% of total sales, indicating market concentration and geographic risk.
   And also, if filtered, Australia dominated almost all product category from 2021 - 2024.
3. The Consumer segment dominated with 50.3% of sales, while Corporate and Home Office held 49.7% combined.
4. Furniture (37.9%) and Technology (36.2%) were the top categories, outperforming Office Supplies.
5. Bookcases, Chairs, and Copiers were the best-selling products, each with sales over 150K.
6. Sales were heavily concentrated among a few customers, with the top 3 alone generating over 23K.
7. Sales remained strong through most of the year, but December saw a mid-month drop, suggesting missed end-of-year
   opportunities.

### Recommendations:
1. Geographic Expansion to reduce dependence on Australia, and expand to markets like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand.
2. Segment Growth is possible, start to focus in B2B Sales, expand 'Corporate' and 'Home Office' sales by offering bundles,
   employee benefit, volume pricing, and service packages.
3. Product Optimization by prioritizing bestsellers item e.g. Bookcases, Chairs, Copiers. Investigate further regarding
   underperformed sales items. Phase out or bundle underperforming products can also be a good strategy for depleting the
   underperformed products.
4. Looking at the monthly trend, there is significant volatility, which indicates there might be strong seasonal / trend
   interest in the market. Must analyze the reason or event behind it, implement marketing and campaign strategy that match.
   Also can use the analysis for inventory strategy.

### Need for futher investigation
To enhance the current insights, further investigation is recommended into product and regional profitability, customer lifetime value and retention trends, the impact of discounts on margins, conversion rates across the sales funnel, changing behaviors within customer segments over time, potential product cannibalization or cross-sell opportunities, and benchmarking performance against competitors to assess market positioning.
